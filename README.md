## Feedback 

# Functionality:
- Lucky button doesn’t work
- All Google buttons showing
- Top links don’t work
- Links from search result don’t work
- There is an error in module/exports in script.js
- The “a” tags filling is empty in openArray function
- To improve, could incorporate the Google search API to get a functional search bar

# Software Design
- Site partially responsive
- Need to fix the footer as the text becomes jumbled together when minimising the screen
- Everything looks like Google which is great

# Test
- Great to see tests! Maybe needs slightly more coverage

# Naming
- Variable and functions names are quite clear to understand

# Comments
There are some general comments, but to have more detailed ones will make understanding more clearer

# Documentation:
-Nice documentation
